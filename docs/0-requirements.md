# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

New members to the D&D club can sometimes struggle to find a campaign to join and DMs can sometimes struggle to find players for their campaign


## End-User Requirements

The primary end-user will be Scott Morrison who is the leader of the D&D club.
I will also be getting feedback from some student members of thr D&D club. 
The specific needs of these end users is to have a simple to use interface so it caters to anyone who may use it. These users will expect a simple and functional interface that fits the aesthetic of D&D. 

the specific functionality requirements are:
- be able to view a concise list of campaigns easily as a player
- be able to view in depth relevant information about a chosen campaign 
- login in as an admin user 
- as an admin edit campaigns 
- as an admin delete campaigns 
- as an admin add new campaigns


## Proposed Solution

My proposed solution is a web app that will allow members of the schools DnD club to see listings of what campaigns are open and get contact info of DMs

# Relevant Implications

## Usability

Is the user able to get things done quickly and easily?. Can the end-user complete tasks or actions easily, with little need for help?

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant as any system should have good usability as if it doesn't the user won't enjoy the experience of using the interface and therefore won't use it in the future.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to make sure I am following standard conventions (e.g. placement of menus, etc.), making the behavior of the outcome logical and familiar, providing the end-user with a clear route forwards (and back out, if needed), always making it obvious to the end-user what is happening. This will impact the project in that I will keep going to my end-user and giving them a chance to navigate the interface in order to get feedback on how usable it is




## Functionality
The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant as any system should function well in relation to its intended function as if it doesn't the user won't enjoy the experience of using the interface and therefore won't use it in the future.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider whether the interface fulfills the intended purpose and need. 
I will need to make sure the interface meets the user requirements. This will impact my project as I will keep going to my end-user and giving them a chance to use the interface in order to get feedback on how well it functions and how well it solves the problems it aims to.


## End-user 

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user and how their needs are met.

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant as my solution is for a group of end-users with a very specific interest and the people span many ages, background and educations so I need to make system that caters for all

### Impact / Considerations

Make sure I consider that the used aesthetic will be pleasing for everyone. Make sure the interface is easy to understand for anyone. Make sure the interface works on all devices. This will impact the project as I will need to check that the interface works on all devices. I need to be in constant communication with my end-user to ensure the interface solves the problem and work well for the end-user.



## Aesthetic

The aesthetic implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how it looks in terms of design.

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant as any system should look good in relation to its intended user as if it doesn't the user won't enjoy the experience of using the interface and therefore won't use it in the future.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider whether the design appeals to my end-users and follows conventions.
I will need to consider how well colour, font and positioning have been used
This will impact my project as I will keep going to my end-user and giving them a chance to use the interface in order to get feedback on whether it is visually appealing and if positioning makes sense.



## Accessibility

The accessibility implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) involve ensuring it is available to, and can be used by, all end-users, regardless of their abilities.

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant as my solution is for a group of end-users from many ages, backgrounds and educations so I need to make system that caters for all

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consider whether all end-users can access the content and functionality such as those with impaired vision, colour-blindness, dyslexia, etc.
I will need to consider whether the interface can be accessed on a range of devices.

# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

New members to the D&D club can sometimes struggle to find a campaign to join and DMs can sometimes struggle to find players for their campaign


## End-User Requirements

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.


The primary end-user will be Scott Morrison who is the leader of the D&D club.
I will also be getting feedback from some student members of thr D&D club. 
The specific needs of these end users is to have a simple to use interface so it caters to anyone who may use it. These users will expect a simple and functional interface that fits the aesthetic of D&D. 


## Proposed Solution

My proposed solution is a webservice that will allow members of the schools DnD club to see listings of what campaigns are open and get contact info of DMs

# Relevant Implications

## Usability

Is the user able to get things done quickly and easily. Can the end-user complete tasks or actions easily, with little need for help?

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant as any system should have good usability as if it doesn't the user won't enjoy the experience of using the interface and therefore won't use it in the future.

### Impact / Considerations

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.

I will need to make sure I am following standard conventions (e.g. placement of menus, etc.), making the behavior of the outcome logical and familiar, providing the end-user with a clear route forwards (and back out, if needed), always making it obvious to the end-user what is happening.
